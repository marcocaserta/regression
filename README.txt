An Introduction to Linear (and Logistics) Regression
====================================================

In this folder, you will find two files, which can be used to develop some
introductory concepts on Regression Analysis. The topics structure is as
follows:

* LINEAR REGRESSION

    1. Simple linear regression
    2. Multiple linear regression
    3. Interaction terms
    4. Quadratic terms
    5. Model building

* LOGISTCS REGRESSION

    1. A simple classification model for the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset

The regression output in these files has been produced using Google
Spreadsheets and an add-on called "XLMiner". To install XLMiner, open a
spreadsheet, and select Add-ons --> Get add-ons.

Some useful materials (a free textbook and some video lectures) can be found
at:

Under the section "Videos", Chapters 7 and 8, you can find a few videos
introducing the most important theoretical concepts of regression analysis,
along with some useful examples.
